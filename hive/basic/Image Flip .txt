Image Flip 
You are given an N x M binary matrix called "image". You need to perform the following operations on the matrix (in order) and return the resulting image:



Flip the image horizontally: This involves reversing the order of elements in each row of the matrix. For example, [1,0,1,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,1,0,1]
Invert the image: This involves replacing 0s with 1s and 1s with 0s in the entire matrix. For example, [0,0,0,1,0,1] becomes [1,1,1,0,1,0]


Input Format

Line of input contains N - number of rows and M - number of columns. The next N lines contains M integers each denoting the elements of the matrix image.



Output Format

You have to print the resultant matrix image.



Constraints

1 <= N <=100

1 <= M <=100
