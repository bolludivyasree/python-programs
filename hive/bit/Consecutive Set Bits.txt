Consecutive Set Bits
Given a number N, find the maximum number of consecutive set bits in the number.



Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by T lines, each containing a single number N.



Output Format

For each test case, print the max number of consecutive set bits, separated by newline.



Constraints

1 <= T <= 10000

0 <= N <= 1018

Explanation



Example 1:

Binary Representation of 5: 101

Maximum Consecutive Set Bits: 1



Example 2:

Binary Representation of 15: 1111

Maximum Consecutive Set Bits: 4



Example 3:

Binary Representation of 13: 1101

Maximum Consecutive Set Bits: 2
