Chef Plays Ludo
Chef is playing Ludo. According to the rules of Ludo, a player can enter a new token into the play only when he rolls a 
6
6 on the die.

In the current turn, Chef rolled the number 
𝑋
X on the die. Determine if Chef can enter a new token into the play in the current turn or not.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer 
𝑇
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer 
𝑋
X — the number rolled by the Chef on the die.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if the Chef can enter a new token in the game. Otherwise, output NO.

You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
