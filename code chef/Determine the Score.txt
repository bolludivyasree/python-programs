Determine the Score
Chef appeared for a placement test.

There is a problem worth 
𝑋
X points. Chef finds out that the problem has exactly 
10
10 test cases. It is known that each test case is worth the same number of points.

Chef passes 
𝑁
N test cases among them. Determine the score Chef will get.

NOTE: See sample explanation for more clarity.

Input Format
First line will contain 
𝑇
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers 
𝑋
X and 
𝑁
N, the total points for the problem and the number of test cases which pass for Chef's solution.
Output Format
For each test case, output the points scored by Chef.

Explanation:
Test Case 
1
1: The problem is worth 
10
10 points and since there are 
10
10 test cases, each test case is worth 
1
1 point. Since Chef passes 
3
3 test cases, his score will be 
1
⋅
3
=
3
1⋅3=3 points.

Test Case 
2
2: The problem is worth 
100
100 points and since there are 
10
10 test cases, each test case is worth 
10
10 points. Since Chef passes all the 
10
10 test cases, his score will be 
10
⋅
10
=
100
10⋅10=100 points.

Test Case 
3
3: The problem is worth 
130
130 points and since there are 
10
10 test cases, each test case is worth 
13
13 points. Since Chef passes 
4
4 test cases, his score will be 
13
⋅
4
=
52
13⋅4=52 points.

Test Case 
4
4: The problem is worth 
70
70 points and since there are 
10
10 test cases, each test case is worth 
7
7 points. Since Chef passes 
0
0 test cases, his score will be 
7
⋅
0
=
0
7⋅0=0 points.
