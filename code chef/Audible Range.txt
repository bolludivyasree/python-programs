Audible Range
Chef's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 
67
67 Hertz to 
45000
45000 Hertz (both inclusive).

If Chef's commands have a frequency of 
𝑋
X Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer 
𝑋
X - the frequency of Chef's commands in Hertz.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Chef's commands. Otherwise, print NO.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: Chef's command has a frequency of 
42
42 Hertz which is less than 
67
67. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.

Test case 
2
2: Chef's command has a frequency of 
67
67 Hertz which lies in the range 
[
67
,
45000
]
[67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.

Test case 
3
3: Chef's command has a frequency of 
402
402 Hertz which lies in the range 
[
67
,
45000
]
[67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.

Test case 
4
4: Chef's command has a frequency of 
45000
45000 Hertz which lies in the range 
[
67
,
45000
]
[67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.

Test case 
5
5: Chef's command has a frequency of 
45005
45005 Hertz which is greater than 
45000
45000. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.
