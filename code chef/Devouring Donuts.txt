Sample 1:
Input
Output
2 280
560
Explanation:
Chef ate two donuts, each containing 
280
280 calories. The total number of calories is thus 
280
+
280
=
560
280+280=560.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
6 237
1422

Chef ate six donuts, each containing 
237
237 calories. The total number of calories is thus 
6
⋅
237
=
1422
6⋅237=1422.
