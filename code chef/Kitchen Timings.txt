Kitchen Timings
The working hours of Chef’s kitchen are from 
𝑋
X pm to 
𝑌
Y pm 
(
1
≤
𝑋
<
𝑌
≤
12
)
(1≤X<Y≤12).

Find the number of hours Chef works.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y — the starting and ending time of working hours respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of hours Chef works.
