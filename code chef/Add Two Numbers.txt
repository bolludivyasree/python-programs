Add Two Numbers
Your task is very simple: given two integers 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B, write a program to add these two numbers and output the sum.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
𝑇
T, the total number of test cases.
Then follow 
𝑇
T lines, each line contains two integers, 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.
Output Format
For each test case, add 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B and display the sum in a new line.

Sample 1:
Input
Output
3
1 2
100 200
10 40
3
300
50
Explanation:
Testcase 1: 
1
+
2
=
3
1+2=3. Hence the first output is 
3
3.

Testcase 2: 
100
+
200
=
300
100+200=300. Hence the second output is 
300
300.
