IPL Ticket Rush
DAIICT college students want to attend an IPL match.

A total of 
𝑁
N students from the college want to go while only 
𝑀
M tickets are available for the match.

Determine how many students won't be able to book tickets.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
𝑁
N and 
𝑀
M — the number of students wants to go and the total number of tickets available, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of students who won't be able to book tickets.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: There are 
5
5 students who want to go, and only 
3
3 tickets are available. Hence 
2
2 students won't be able to get tickets.

Test case 
2
2: There are 
5
5 students who want to go, and 
7
7 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.

Test case 
3
3: There are 
4
4 students who want to go, and only 
1
1 ticket is available. Hence 
3
3 students won't be able to get tickets.

Test case 
4
4: There are 
8
8 students who want to go, and 
8
8 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.
