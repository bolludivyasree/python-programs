You just bought a new calculator, but it seems to have a small problem: all its results have an extra 
1
1 appended to the end.
For example, if you ask it for 3 + 5, it'll print 81, and 4 + 12 will result in 161.

Given 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B, can you predict what the calculator will print when you ask it for 
𝐴
+
𝐵
A+B?

Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain two space-separated integers 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.
Output Format
Print a single integer: the calculator's output when you enter 
𝐴
+
𝐵
A+B into it.

Constraints
1
≤
𝐴
,
𝐵
≤
50
1≤A,B≤50
Sample 1:
Input
Output
3 5
81
Explanation:
3
+
5
=
8
3+5=8, and the calculator appends a 
1
1 to print 
81
81.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
4 12
161
Explanation:
4
+
12
=
16
4+12=16, and the calculator appends a 
1
1 to print 
161
161.
