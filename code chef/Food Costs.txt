Food Costs
You're a bit all over the place as a college student. You used to eat out at expensive restaurants almost every day until your parents gave you a talking-to about being irresponsible. Now, you've got to control your eating and spending habits.

So, here's the plan: you'll stick to the college mess for your meals every day, except Sundays. On Sundays, you're treating yourself to those fancy restaurant meals.
The cost is Rs. 
𝑋
X for the mess food each day, and Rs. 
𝑌
Y for the restaurant splurges.

Now, what's the cost of food per week? Note that you don't have to pay for the mess on Sundays.
A week has seven days, as usual.
