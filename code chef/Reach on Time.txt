Reach on Time
Chef has recently moved into an apartment. It takes 
30
30 minutes for Chef to reach office from the apartment.

Chef left for the office 
𝑋
X minutes before Chef was supposed to reach. Determine whether or not Chef will be able to reach on time.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer 
𝑋
X.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef will reach on time, NO otherwise.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef leaves 
30
30 minutes before he is supposed to reach, so he will reach the office exactly on time since it takes 
30
30 minutes to commute.

Test case 2: Chef will reach 
30
30 minutes early.

Test case 3: Chef will reach 16 minutes late.
