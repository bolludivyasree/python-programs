Fan Poll
Chef Sports conducted a fan poll to find out who their fans thought was the best captain.
The three players nominated were Dhoni, Rohit, and Kohli. They received 
𝐴
,
𝐵
,
A,B, and 
𝐶
C votes, respectively.

Find out whether Dhoni won the poll, i.e, if he received the maximum number of votes.

Note: It is guaranteed that no two players received the same number of votes.

Input Format
The only line of input contains three space-separated integers 
𝐴
A, 
𝐵
B, and 
𝐶
C — the number of votes obtained by Dhoni, Rohit, and Kohli, respectively.

Output Format
Print the answer on a single line: "Yes" (without quotes) if Dhoni won the poll, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings No, no, nO, and NO` will all be treated as equivalent.
